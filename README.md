# <HoriSEOn>

## Description

I have created this project to improve visibility of the website and make sure to improve a usability experience for users that have any type of inclusions

- I wanted to improve the site for visually impaired people and to simplify it as much as possible for all the users overall.
- The project was created to improve overall site experience that includes navigation, search engines ranking and usability
- It solved the navigation and usaility issues. 
- I learnt how to work with sections and separators in a more effective way and have a better understanding of structuring the code now.

## Installation
An access to Horeseon website is required, it`s possible to access it if to use my repository.

## Usage

There is a navigation bar that takes a user to the required section of the website. Also, the sections are correlated with the homepage pictures

## Credits

I used materials to read more about separators and sections with the https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/ inner materials
I have structured the Readme file due to https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide 
For web accessibility features, I consulted https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-accessibility, https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/
